## Assignment 1: Decision Trees
In this assignment, we explored Decision Trees as a method for both classification and regression tasks. The primary objectives were:
- Understanding the theory behind Decision Trees.
- Implementing Decision Trees using scikit-learn.
- Evaluating model performance through metrics like accuracy, Gini impurity, and mean squared error.

### Files
- `Decision-Trees.ipynb`: Contains the code for training and evaluating Decision Trees for different tasks.

## Assignment 2: Nearest Neighbors
This assignment focused on the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm, a simple yet effective technique for classification and regression. Key learning outcomes included:
- Understanding the working of the k-NN algorithm.
- Implementing k-NN for classification tasks and analyzing its performance.
- Experimenting with different values of k and distance metrics to see their effects on model performance.

### Files
- `Nearest-Neighbors.ipynb`: Script for implementing and evaluating the k-NN algorithm.

## Assignment 3: ROC Analysis
In this assignment, we performed Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate binary classifiers. The objectives were:
- Understanding the ROC curve and AUC (Area Under the Curve) metric.
- Comparing the performance of different classifiers using ROC curves.
- Implementing ROC analysis in Python and interpreting the results.

### Files
- `ROC-Analysis.ipynb`: Code for generating and interpreting ROC curves and AUC scores for various classifiers.

## Assignment 4: Clustering
This assignment introduced clustering techniques, focusing on K-means and hierarchical clustering. The key learning outcomes were:
- Understanding the concept and applications of clustering.
- Implementing K-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms.
- Evaluating clustering results using metrics such as silhouette score and inertia.

### Files
- `Clustering.ipynb`: Contains the implementation of K-means and hierarchical clustering with evaluation.

## Assignment 5: Linear Regression Models
In the final assignment, we explored Linear Regression models for predictive analysis. The objectives were:
- Understanding the principles of linear regression.
- Implementing linear regression models for both simple and multiple regression tasks.
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### Files
- `Linear-Regression.ipynb`: Script for building and evaluating linear regression models.

## Results and Reports
Detailed analysis, results, and discussions are included in the respective Jupyter notebooks for each assignment. Additionally, there are comprehensive reports accompanying each assignment, providing in-depth explanations, methodologies, and interpretations of the results obtained from the models.

Feel free to explore the code, use it as a reference for your own projects, and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement.
